                    <p>"The Mediterranean Wrap was so tasty! I love how close this place is to my work and gym. This is my new go&ndash;to when I need something quick and healthy during the day! Can't wait to try everything on the menu!"" </p>

                    <h3>Great Choice of Parking Spot</h3>
                    <p>"I stumbled on Rogue Pickings food truck while out for a walk on my lunch break in Golden Gate Park. The perfect setting for a lovely picnic lunch. And the food is great, too." </p>

                    <h3>Best Falafel Salad Ever!</h3>
                    <p>"I got so excited about the yumminess of the falafel salad that I am typing this review as I inhale my lunch. Yes it is that good.... Service was super friendly and quick. Can't wait see you Rogue Pickings again tomorrow!"</p>

                    <h3>I'd give it 5 Stars</h3>
                    <p>Amazingly tasty, truck is clean, and the staff is friendly. So happy to have a healthy and delicious quick option in the area." </p>

                    <h3>Super Amazing Tasty Food!</h3>
                    <p>I'm not one to typically eat very healthy, but I was recently introduced to Rogue Pickings, and I am hooked! I've been eating lunch here three or more times a week! It's delicious and good for me. Only suggestion I have? Punch cards! Otherwise the food is amazing, the staff is super friendly and they are prompt."</p>

                    <h3>Staff is Very Helpful</h3>
                    <p>"The service here is top-notch. It was my first time at the truck today, and the woman at the counter was very kind in helping me decide what to order. Price was similar to Subway or Chipotle, I think I paid &dollar;9ish for the wrap. Excellent healthy option and great staff." </p>
